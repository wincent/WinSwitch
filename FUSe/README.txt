1. What is FUSe?
========================================

FUSe is a menu extra, that allows you to use fast user switching in Panther while not wasting menubar space. This is by no means release-grade software, neither feature nor code wise.

Original creator of FUSe is Martin Pittenauer (www.codingmonkeys.de).


2. Installation
========================================

1. Get and install MenuCracker.menu to enable 3rd party MenuExtras.
   (Download at http://sourceforge.net/projects/menucracker/)
   I'd recommend putting it to /Library/MenuExtras/ as you probably
   want it to be available for all users.
2. Copy FUSe.menu to /Library/MenuExtras/ and double click it

FUSe can be dragged around or thrown out of the menubar while holding the command key.


3. Licensing
========================================

If you add features, send a copy to map@codingmonkeys.de.
