CHANGELOG for WinSwitch
$Id$

Version 3.0b release ( October 2004):
  - adjustable user icon size inside the body of the menu itself (not just in the menu bar)
  - Norwegian localization by Sjur N¿rsteb¿ Moshagen
  - changes to "Activate WinSwitch" script to make it more tolerant of errors reported by the system
  - work around bug in the Apple frameworks that could cause WinSwitch to die if any user pictures had multiple (NSImageRep) representations
  - minor optimizations in bundle- and notification-handling code
  - tightened up the code in some places to make the source shorter and more readable
  - promoted "First name only" and "Initials only" to user-visible preferences (no longer accessible only from the command line), with live updating of menu bar if the username is edited in the Accounts preference pane
  - "Initials only" method now considers period, comma and space to be word boundary markers
  - stricter filtering of items in the "Switch-In Items" and "Switch-Out Items" folders; any filename beginning with a period is ignored (previously only .DS_Store files were explicitly ignored)
  - WinSwitchHelper: new bundled background helper application efficiently monitors for addition of Apple version of Fast User Switching menu and displays a notification bezel telling the user of how to remove it
  - WinSwitchHelper: basic hot-key support: Control-Alt-Delete takes user to loginwindow (note that it is Delete and not Backspace)
  - WinSwitchHelper: preferences window provides quick access to all WinSwitch options, a help button, and buttons to access the "Switch-In Items" and "Switch-Out Items" in the Finder
  - Finnish localization by Lauri Vanajas

Version 2.0 release (7 September 2004):
  - bugfix: root user, if logged in, would appear in menu regardless of preferences
  - feature: optionally launch items on switch-out, switch-in (searches in "~/Library/Application Support/WinSwitch/Switch-Out Items/" and "~/Library/Application Support/WinSwitch/Switch-In Items/" respectively)
  - more source code cleanups
  - minor optimizations (eliminating some redundant code)
  - feature: command-line option to show "First name only" (long username truncated at first space); defaults write com.wincent.WinSwitch "Menu bar style" '4'
  - feature: command-line option to show "Initials only"; defaults write com.wincent.WinSwitch "Menu bar style" '5'
  - bugfix: additions to build process to strip out .svn directories left inside MenuCracker.menu

Version 1.5 release (23 August 2004):
  - Dutch localization by Joost Kroon
  - Minor corrections to Japanese and Swedish localizations
  - bugfix: restored custom icon on "Activate WinSwitch" command which had been stripped in the move Subversion
  - new winswitch-announce and winswitch-beta mailing lists

Version 1.4.1 release (26 July 2004):
  - Danish localization by Jesper Juul Keller
  - bugfix: activate-winswitch.sh had its executable permissions stripped when in the shift to the Subversion repository

Version 1.4 release (26 July 2004):
  - "Show" submenu provides option to include root user in the menu
  - added utility scripts for tagging/branching with Subversion repository

Version 1.4b2 limited seed (22 July 2004):
  - bugfix: handle case where non-local user logs out but corresponding entry continues in menu

Version 1.4b limited seed (14 July 2004):
  - bugfix: match Apple behaviour of showing non-local users if and only if they are logged in on the current machine
  - bugfix: correctly handle unlikely case where no long username is defined in the NetInfo database
  - ongoing improvements to source code for readability
  - activation script tweak; wait a few seconds and retry activation on a slow or heavily loaded machine

Version 1.3 release (14 July 2004):
  - added a user defaults setting for users who prefer to have their picture 16x16 (in the Terminal "defaults write com.wincent.WinSwitch 'User picture size' -float 16.0"; to use 19x19 pictures "defaults write com.wincent.WinSwitch 'User picture size' -fl
oat 19.0"; changes take effect on next login or next time WinSwitch is added to menu bar); values less than 5.0 or greater than 19.0 will be ignored, although in practice anything smaller than 16.0 is too small to clearly see
  - Japanese localization by Yuzuru Shiraiwa
  - now uses Install version 1.2.2
  - optimizations for speed
  - more cosmetic code changes to improve readability
  - recompiled with latest build of Apple's Xcode Tools

Version 1.2.1 release (19 June 2004):
  - increased size of the user picture in the menu bar (now 19x19 pixels instead of 16x16)
  - Italian localization by Michele Zangrossi
  - added Swedish localization by Christoffer Araskog
  - fixed bug that could prevent "Login window" and other menu items from appearing at the bottom of the menu
  - this also fixes the "items listed twice" bug (bug 303)
  - minor cosmetic changes to source code to improve readability
  - now uses Install version 1.2.1

Version 1.2 release (5 April 2004):
  - include NetInfo header files with source code distribution
  - query NetInfo (man 3 netinfo) directly instead of going through getpwent()
  - this enables the exclusion of non-local users, and is more resource-efficient
  - also means that NSTask (nicl) to get user pictures is no longer necessary
  - also means that WinSwitch response time when full username is edited is now instant 
  - I believe this also cures the double listing of users that can occur using getpwent()
  - make error checking less stringent in installer
  - French localization by Fabrice Laurens
  - further improvements to source code for clarity and readability

Version 1.1 release (1 April 2004):
  - MenuCracker.menu now embedded in WinSwitch bundle for tidier distribution
  - choice of generic or custom icon, or long or short username in menubar
  - use case insensitive sorting, like Apple's menu (bug 285)
  - insert generic user icon for users without pictures (bug 285)
  - listen for notifications from System Preferences of user changes
  - listen for session switching notifications (more efficient)
  - fixed display and SystemUIServer crash issues caused by ".userImage" extensions (bugs 286, 287)
  - fixed a memory leak (NSMenuItems leaked on every invocation of -menu: method)
  - another memory leak (NSAttributedString in -_menuString: method)
  - German localization by Jan Maas
  - improved installation procedure
  - "Open Accounts..." menu item (opens Accounts.prefPane)

Version 1.0 initial release (29 March 2004):
  - construct user list by using getpwent()
  - use full usernames, like Apple's User.menu
  - use NSMenuItem -setRepresentedObject/-representedObject to identify users
  - prepared for internationalization and added Spanish localization
  - add correct highlight behaviour in menu bar, like Apple NSMenuExtras
  - add custom icon for .menu bundle
  - minor optimizations
  - userlist sorted alphabetically, like Apple's User.menu
  - NetInfo queried for path to user icon, if available
  - use tick like Apple's User.menu for currently logged in users
  - fixed a couple of potential minor memory leaks
  - reformatted code to wrap to 80 column format where possible
  - dim icon (and tick) for current user
  - ignore "users" with non-real shells (eg. /usr/bin/false)
