TODO for WinSwitch
$Id$

- bugfix: figure out how to activate for all users, thus obviating the need for the "Activate WinSwitch" command

- request: anti-alias user picture in menu bar (similar to iChat, which appears to use high interpolation)

- request: offer a greyscale version of the user icon

- request: override default NSAttributedString behaviour so that users who use "themes" see the menu item text in their chosen color

- try to log out current user if holding down option key (do this only once the notification of switch out has been received)

- request: "You should disable the main user switch menu, whenever the accounts preference pane is opened, it puts the original one back"; note this is not possible without entering a race, so WinSwitchHelper throws up a notification bezel instead

- request: "Ignore list": ability to ignore arbitrary accounts (ie. exclude them from the list)

- ability to assign a separate hot key for each user account
