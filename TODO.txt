- request: anti-alias user picture in menu bar (similar to iChat, which appears to use high interpolation)

- request: ability to set a hot key to bring up the login window (would require background daemon app to listen for hot keys)

- request: offer a greyscale version of the user icon

- request: override default NSAttributedString behaviour so that users who use "themes" see the menu item text in their chosen color

- request: option to show "first name only" (long username truncated at first space)

- bugfix: repair the to two casualties in the move to Subversion: the custom icon on the MenuCrack.menu bundle, and the custom icon on the activate-winswitch.command (the resource fork and the metadata, respectively, stripped by the move); partial solution may be /Developer/Tools/DeRez and /Developer/Tools/Rez
