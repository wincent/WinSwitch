- request: anti-alias user picture in menu bar (similar to iChat, which appears to use high interpolation)

- request: ability to set a hot key to bring up the login window (would require background daemon app to listen for hot keys)

- request: offer a greyscale version of the user icon

- request: override default NSAttributedString behaviour so that users who use "themes" see the menu item text in their chosen color
