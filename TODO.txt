- request: anti-alias user picture in menu bar (similar to iChat, which appears to use high interpolation)

- request: ability to set a hot key to bring up the login window (would require background daemon app to listen for hot keys, or registration of Carbon Event Handler; not sure if this can be done from an NSMenuExtra)

- request: offer a greyscale version of the user icon

- request: override default NSAttributedString behaviour so that users who use "themes" see the menu item text in their chosen color

- request: option to show "first name only" (long username truncated at first space)

- request: option to show "initials only"
