TODO for WinSwitch
$Id$

- bugfix: figure out how to activate for all users, thus obviating the need for the "Activate WinSwitch" command

- request: anti-alias user picture in menu bar (similar to iChat, which appears to use high interpolation)

- request: offer a greyscale version of the user icon

- request: override default NSAttributedString behaviour so that users who use "themes" see the menu item text in their chosen color

- try to log out current user if holding down option key (do this only once the notification of switch out has been received)

- request: "You should disable the main user switch menu, whenever the accounts preference pane is opened, it puts the original one back"; note this is not possible without entering a race

- need to update installer to add background app to login items, remove it from login items on uninstall, update login items on upgrade
